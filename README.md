# Gas Pump Headcounter System

This repository contains the implementation of a simple Gas Pump Headcounter System, developed as part of an Embedded System Project. 

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Counting**: Tracks the number of heads interacting with the gas pump.
- **Embedded System Integration**: Utilizes STM32F411RET6 peripherals for KEYPAD and LCD.
- **Modular Design**: Codebase is structured for easy understanding, debugging, and maintenance.

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible microcontroller (e.g., STM32 or equivalent)
- A development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE or Keil uVision)
- Required hardware:
  - LCD 3x6 display for output (optional)
  - Keypad 5x5 for manual interaction
- Required dependencies:
  - freeRTOS
  - ARM toolchain (if compiling manually)
  - Hardware abstraction libraries (e.g., STM32 HAL or LL drivers)
  - OpenOCD or ST-Link tools for flashing firmware

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robotanh/EMBEDDED_SYSTEM_PROJECT.git
cd EMBEDDED_SYSTEM_PROJECT
```

### Step 2: Open the Project

1. Launch your development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE).
2. Import the project using the `File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace` option.
3. Select the folder where the repository was cloned.

### Step 3: Build the Project

1. Ensure that the correct microcontroller target is selected in your IDE.
2. Compile the project by clicking on `Build` or using the `Ctrl+B` shortcut.

### Step 4: Flash the Firmware

1. Connect your microcontroller to the computer using a USB-to-UART adapter or ST-Link programmer.
2. Flash the firmware to the microcontroller:
   - Using STM32CubeIDE: Click `Run -> Debug` or press `F11`.
   - Using ST-Link: Use the `st-flash` command-line tool:
     ```bash
     st-flash write <firmware.bin> 0x8000000
     ```

### Step 5: Connect the Hardware

1. Attach the input and output devices to the STM32F411RET6 as per the pin configurations in the code.
2. Power the system using a suitable power source.

### Step 6: Run the System

1. Once flashed, the microcontroller should start executing the program.
2. Monitor the headcounter functionality through 3x6 LCD.
